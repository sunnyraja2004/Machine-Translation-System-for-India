README FOR BLEU metric:

Calculate BLEU Score for Text Comparison
This script calculates the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score for comparing two text files. The BLEU score is a metric commonly used in natural language processing and machine translation to evaluate the similarity between two sets of text.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python (3.5 or higher)
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library


Understanding the Output
The BLEU score is a value between 0 and 1, where a higher score indicates greater similarity between the two sets of text. The output of the script will be a decimal number representing the BLEU score.

Note
Make sure both input files (file1.txt and file2.txt) are in UTF-8 encoding and contain text data.
